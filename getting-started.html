# Getting Started

1. [Download Jupiter](http://github.com/mushishi78/jupiter/archive/master.zip) or clone git repository:

  ```
  git clone http://github.com/mushishi78/jupiter my-project
  ```

2. Edit files. (If you don't have a text editor, try [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)).

3. To serve files in development use a small web server such as [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server), (otherwise your browser won't be able to follow relative links).

4. Upload to pretty much any website host: [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), shared hosting...etc
