# What is it?

Jupiter is an implementation of the *static*, static-site generator concept, first implemented with the [Jr.](https://github.com/Xeoncross/jr) project.

Static-site generators, such as [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), take markup and template files and generate the files for a static website. When the site is changed, the generator is run again to generate a new set of files.

A static, static-site generator avoids the step of having to run a generator by delivering the markup files straight to the client and using javascript to run the templates on the fly.

Take a look at source code of this page to see for yourself.
